There will be an amuesment park, and player will be the ticket collector.
The civilians will pay player for their tickets, but sometimes they will
try to fool the player by not giving them money, and the player has to 
catch and fight them in an epic 1vs1 battle, with special attacks, moves
power-ups, potions etc.

Enemies get harder and harder to fight as you progress (It is infinite) and you
can level up too. You lose the moment you are defeated, and have to start all
over again.
